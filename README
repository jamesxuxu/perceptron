Homework:
Implement SGD for SVM for the adult income dataset. Experiment with performance as a function of the capacity parameter C.

************ Files *********
Bian_Xin_hw3.py: main implementation of SVM
plot.py: use for conducting experiment of Capacity and plotting results
plot.png: figure of Capacity experiment

************ Algorithm *****
SGD for Linear SVM is used.

In the main code, some default parameters are:
	learning rate: 0.1
	epochs: 1
	capacity: 0.868

In the plot code, the parameters are:
	capacity: 10E-3 to 10E4
	learning rate: 0.1
	epochs: 5
	
************ Instructions ***
The code is written by python3.

For main code Bian_Xin_hw3.py:
sample running command: ./Bian_Xin_hw3.py --epochs 1 --capacity 0.868
	where you can specify epochs and capacity, otherwise default values are used (epochs=1, capacity=0.868)

For plot code plot.py:
run by ./plot.py
The result will be saved in the same folder with the name plot.png

************ Results *******
The results on test and development datasets are similar.

The accuracy increases when capacity starts increasing from 10E-3, then achieves maximum accuracy (>0.84) at capacity around 0.1. When the capacity is further increased, the accuracy starts to decrease and fluctuates. The performance becomes worse. The accuracy can be as low as ~0.71 when capacity is about 5*10E3.

************ Your interpretation **** (Attention: important!)

Your understanding of the results, for instance, "from the above results, learning rate is very important that a learning rate from XX to XX yields the best result, and that a learning rate larger than XX yields a significant drop of the performance"
