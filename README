Implement SGD for SVM for the adult income dataset. Experiment with performance as a function of the capacity parameter C.

************ Files *********
Bian_Xin_hw3.py: main implementation of SVM
plot.py: use for conducting experiment of Capacity and plotting results
plot.png: figure of Capacity experiment

************ Algorithm *****
SGD for Linear SVM is used.

The gradient is updated by:

if y*(w^T*x+b) > 1:
	df/dw = w/N - C*y*x
	df/db = - C*y
else:
	df/dw = w/N
	df/db = 0


In the main code, some default parameters are:
	learning rate: 0.1
	epochs: 1
	capacity: 0.868

In the plot code, the parameters are:
	capacity: 10E-3 to 10E4
	learning rate: 0.1
	epochs: 5
	
************ Instructions *************
The code is written in python3. Library matplotlib is needed for plotting.

For main code Bian_Xin_hw3.py:
sample running command: ./Bian_Xin_hw3.py --epochs 1 --capacity 0.868
	where you can specify epochs and capacity, otherwise default values are used (epochs=1, capacity=0.868)

For plot code plot.py:
run by ./plot.py
The result will be saved in the same folder with the name plot.png

************ Results ************
The results on test and development datasets are similar.

The accuracy increases when capacity starts increasing from 10E-3, then achieves maximum accuracy (>0.84) at capacity around 0.1. When the capacity is further increased, the accuracy starts to decrease and fluctuates. The performance becomes worse. The accuracy can be as low as ~0.71 when capacity is about 5*10E3.

************ Your interpretation **********

The result shows Capacity is a important parameter in SVM.

The increasing or decreasing of capacity doesn't simply mean better performance. The experiment shows selecting a capacity value around 0.1 will have the best performance under this problem. Selecting larger capacity will bring unstable performance and significantly decrease accuracy even to 70%.

In order to select appropriate capacity, experiments need to be done to find the optimum.
